# Content Insights 
The video explains how SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and its importance in training. It is a critical CSS pre-processor that enables web designers to write efficiently. It also allows events and colors to be extended hence enabling them to programmatically manipulate the appearance and efficient use of a website. The online learning course of SASS essential training enables web designers and developers to learn the fundamentals of SASS. The video covers topics such as the creation of variables, the uses of preprocessors, and changing web styles with logic. The concept of mixins-modular is also introduced and can be used to quickly attain results. The video also dives deep to provide basics for someone getting started In SASS using simple terms. The video is also crucial for seasoned veterans since they can utilize the short learning curve and quickly dive into new projects.
# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Experts with a conceptual understanding of SASS can be hired to offer services to a wide range of companies. Companies use preprocessors to reduce time, and the cost in development hence increasing performance as well as the breakdown of the codebase they operate. Therefore SASS can offer job opportunities for those with knowledge. SASS can also offer job opportunities for those with knowledge of preprocessors such as front-end developers, and graphic designers among others. With knowledge of SASS, professionals can also land into jobs and career opportunities in developing platforms like Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal since they require knowledge of SASS.

In terms of learning, SASS is a critical tool that has enabled web developers to create stylesheets. Therefore, taking this course can highly boost oneâ€™s skills in web design. It helps learners to acquire a new dimension in the web designing process hence designing complex design structures easily. The video also provides detailed information such as creating variables and using mixins among others which can be used by learners to design effectively with greater time saving and produce quality end products. Therefore SASS enables learners to stay updated and aligned with up-to-date knowledge. 
# Theory
Incorporating spaced repetition in learning activities to help in retaining information more effectively instead of cramming.
# Test
-To determine the effectiveness of the theory, the following steps would be used to test it;
-The first one is selecting a subject/topic to focus on. An example would be learning about web development.
-Next is dividing the learning materials into small concepts which can be manageable. An example is HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
-Setting up a study schedule for maybe a week then allocate time for each concept.
-For the first concept, for example, JavaScript, study it intensively for a continuous time like 3 hours.
-A short break of around 15 minutes after studying is crucial.
-Next, return to studying the same concept and review it for a shorter duration, for example, 45 minutes.
-Now repeat steps 5 and 6 for the remaining concepts (CSS, HTML) throughout the week.
-At the end of the week assess your understanding of the concepts by taking quizzes, self-tests, or even by explaining to someone else your understanding.
# Expected Outcome
The effectiveness of the theory should be seen or observed in better understanding and retention of the concepts covered as compared to previous weeks of cramming and studying without spaced repetition.

This experiment follows a basic scientific method by formulating a hypothesis, designing a test, and evaluating as well as analysis of the results to determine its effectiveness. It is crucial to record own observations and reflect on the outcomes to conclude the learning method.
