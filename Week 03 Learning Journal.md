WordPress workflow can enhance the user's experience when visiting one's website and make working on a project more manageable. The first step is building a WordPress website, and there is the desire to launch it and begin creating content right away. The first step is deciding how they will proceed when working on the project. The next is setting up the site on a live host. Thirdly, one must create and post content on the site. Finally, one should understand ways of managing media on the site. 
For the WordPress site to work, it needs a domain name, space for storing WordPress, and a database. There are two recommended versions when considering the kinds of hosting, including traditional shared or managed hosting. The former is cheaper but requires extra work, while the latter is expensive, but the service provider manages WordPress for the client. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Website developers and software engineers can use child themes to make their work easier since they can edit their designs without affecting the parent theme. I found it interesting to learn about setting up a WordPress workflow, and I will use this information in the future. Anybody can use such details despite their training since the code is pre-written in the WordPress theme manual, and one only needs to understand how to insert it in the parent code. Since technology means that everything from advertising, publishing, blogging, vlogging, marketing, and making sales is happening online, handling a website is vital. It can make one more marketable and ensure one can function and thrive in a dynamic and changing work environment.
