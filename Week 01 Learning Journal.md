I learned about web design and development in the code and no-code era through this introduction to web design and development.
Companies today perceive websites as essential, and organisations no longer consider them optional. And a group of developers frequently builds and maintains these websites. In addition to coding, several other areas of knowledge are crucial for supporting the development and upkeep of websites, including social media management, content strategy, user experience, user interface design, search engine optimization, email marketing, and many more.  Began by looking at terms used often in the industry, such as client, server, and browser. A brief explanation of website planning and prototyping, examining the disciplines of user experience and user interface. Found that The three technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—power the front end of webpages. Explored the world without codes. Without learning how to code, there are various tools accessible for creating websites.

I learned that practising at the same time as learning from videos helped a lot. I tried the challenge that is given in the course, which helped me figure out the areas on which I needed to focus.
